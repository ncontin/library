Project: Library | The Odin Project

## Introduction

This is a small Library app that extends the 'Book' example. The app allows users to store their books in a library, with details such as the author, title, number of pages, and read status.

## Setup

The project is set up with skeleton HTML/CSS and JS files.

## Features

-   The app stores book objects in a simple array.
-   Users can input their book details, which are then stored as new book objects in the array.
-   The app displays each book in the library on the page, either in a table or on their own "card".
-   There is a "NEW BOOK" button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book.
-   Each book's display has a button to remove the book from the library.
-   Each book's display has a button to change its read status.

## Usage

To add a new book to the library, click the "NEW BOOK" button and fill in the details in the form. To remove a book from the library, click the "Remove" button on the book's display. To change a book's read status, click the "Change Read Status" button on the book's display.

## Note

The app does not currently have any type of storage. The library is reset when the page is refreshed.
